# YOLOv5 Dataset Configuration for Package Damage Detection
# Usage: python train.py --data damage.yaml

# Dataset paths (relative to yolov5 directory)
path: ../package_damage_detector/data
train: images/train
val: images/val
test: images/test

# Number of classes
nc: 5

# Class names - these must match exactly during labeling
names:

# 1: surface_breach - Tears, punctures, holes, rips, burst seams
# 2: contamination_stain - Water stains, oil marks, chemical spills, mold
# 3: compression_damage - Crushed corners, collapsed edges, buckling
# 4: tape_seal_damage - Torn tape, missing tape, peeling labels, broken straps
