# YOLOv5 Hyperparameters for Package Damage Detection
# Optimized for industrial damage detection on sealed packages

# Learning rate
lr0: 0.01  # Initial learning rate
lrf: 0.01  # Final learning rate (lr0 * lrf)
momentum: 0.937  # SGD momentum / Adam beta1
weight_decay: 0.0005  # Optimizer weight decay

# Warmup
warmup_epochs: 3.0
warmup_momentum: 0.8
warmup_bias_lr: 0.1

# Loss weights
box: 0.05  # Box loss gain
cls: 0.5  # Class loss gain
obj: 1.0  # Object loss gain (scale with pixels)

# Anchor settings
anchor_t: 4.0  # Anchor-multiple threshold

# Augmentation - tuned for package inspection
# Less aggressive than general object detection
hsv_h: 0.010  # Image HSV-Hue augmentation (fraction) - reduced for consistent lighting
hsv_s: 0.5    # Image HSV-Saturation augmentation (fraction)
hsv_v: 0.3    # Image HSV-Value augmentation (fraction)
degrees: 5.0  # Image rotation (+/- deg) - packages are usually upright
translate: 0.1  # Image translation (+/- fraction)
scale: 0.3    # Image scale (+/- gain)
shear: 2.0    # Image shear (+/- deg) - minimal shear expected
perspective: 0.0  # Image perspective (+/- fraction) - fixed camera position
flipud: 0.0   # Image flip up-down (probability) - disabled, packages have orientation
fliplr: 0.5   # Image flip left-right (probability)

# Mosaic augmentation - helpful for varying package sizes
mosaic: 0.8  # Mosaic augmentation (probability)
mixup: 0.1   # MixUp augmentation (probability)
copy_paste: 0.0  # Copy-paste augmentation (probability) - not applicable

# IoU settings
iou_t: 0.20  # IoU training threshold
